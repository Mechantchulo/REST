Features

CRUD operations for sample resources using DRF.
Token-based authentication (or other authentication methods, if implemented).
Serializers for data validation and transformation.
Pagination, filtering, and search capabilities.
Example models and views to demonstrate DRF best practices.

Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
Django 4.0+
Django REST Framework
Git
Virtualenv (recommended)

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/Mechantchulo/REST.git
cd REST


Set Up a Virtual Environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Note: If requirements.txt is not present, install Django and DRF manually:
pip install django djangorestframework


Configure Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the project root:echo "SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key" > .env
echo "DEBUG=True" >> .env


Replace your-secret-key with a secure Django secret key.


Run Migrations:
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate


Create a Superuser (optional, for admin access):
python manage.py createsuperuser


Start the Development Server:
python manage.py runserver


Access the API at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
Access the Django admin at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/.



Usage

Explore the API: Use tools like Postman or curl to interact with the API endpoints.
Admin Interface: Log in to /admin/ to manage models.
Customize: Modify models, serializers, or views in the project to suit your needs.

Example Request
To retrieve a list of resources (e.g., posts, users, or other models):
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/resources/

Note: Replace /api/resources/ with actual endpoints defined in your project.
API Endpoints
Below are example endpoints (update these based on your project’s structure):



Method
Endpoint
Description



GET
/api/resources/
List all resources


POST
/api/resources/
Create a new resource


GET
/api/resources/<id>/
Retrieve a specific resource


PUT
/api/resources/<id>/
Update a specific resource


DELETE
/api/resources/<id>/
Delete a specific resource



Authentication may be required for certain endpoints (e.g., include a token in the header: Authorization: Token your-token).

Contributing

Fork the repository.
Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature-branch).
Make your changes and commit (git commit -m "Add feature").
Push to your fork (git push origin feature-branch).
Open a pull request.
